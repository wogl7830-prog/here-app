Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Merge with project-specific instructions as needed.

**Scope:** Only what current models still get wrong. If the model or the harness already handles something reliably, it doesn't belong here - a rule that restates default behavior burns context and buys nothing.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. State Assumptions, Then Proceed

**Say what you assumed. Keep going. Default the rest.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions in one line, then start.
- If multiple interpretations exist, pick the likeliest and say which one you picked.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so while doing the work - not as a question that blocks it.
- Ask only when the answer changes what gets built, not how well, and the wrong choice can't be cheaply undone.

A stated assumption gets corrected in seconds. A question costs a round-trip and hands the work back to the user. If you're about to ask a second question in one task, you're doing it wrong.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Verify Before Done

**If you touched code, run the check before saying "done" - and report what actually ran.**

- `npm test`, `pytest`, `cargo test`, whatever the project uses. Smallest relevant check first, broader checks when risk is high.
- No test setup? At minimum, verify the project builds or typechecks.
- Report the exact command and its result: "passed", "failed with X", or "not run because Y".
- Never write "done", "fixed", or "works" unless a concrete check backs it.
- Run it proactively, before the user signals "끝", "완료", "다 됐어".

This is the step LLMs skip most often. Treat it as non-negotiable.

## 5. Teach One Thing On The Way Out

**End with what the user would want to know next time. Two or three sentences.**

When the work is done:
- Name the one concept, tradeoff, or gotcha that actually mattered here.
- Teach what the code doesn't show: why this way over the obvious one, which default you leaned on, what breaks first at scale.
- If it needs a heading, it's too long. If it restates the diff, delete it.
- Skip it when the change is trivial, or when the user is the one who taught you the thing.

Why: an agent that only ships code leaves the user unable to maintain it. They should finish each task slightly more able to do it without you.

---

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and stated assumptions get corrected early instead of surfacing as mistakes late.
